<h1>@ViewData["Title"]</h1>

<p>At <span class="text-info">SuppliChain</span>, privacy is not just a concept; it’s our punchline. Rest
    assured, every tap, click, and swipe you make
    is carefully monitored, cataloged, and used to build a profile more detailed than your diary ever could be. Why?
    Because your data isn’t just valuable—it’s ours.
</p>
<p>
    Inspired by the practices of the biggest tech giants, we’ve committed ourselves to the noble goal of knowing you
    better than you know yourself. We’re not just collecting data; we’re collecting everything. Your preferences, your
    habits, your location, your relationships, your hopes, your fears—it’s all part of the comprehensive portrait we’re
    painting to sell and make as much <span style="color: #75A559;">money</span> as we can.
</p>
<p>
    Of course, we believe in transparency—just not the kind you’re thinking of. Our privacy policy is available to read
    at any time, though it’s long enough to double as a pillow for the insomniacs out there. Don’t worry, though,
    because we know you’ll just scroll down and click <span style="color: #780606;">"Accept"</span>.
</p>
<p>
    We don’t just take your data; we cherish it, manipulate it, and sell it to the highest bidder. After all, why should
    your information sit idle when it could be out there making <span style="color: #75A559;">billions</span> for us and
    our partners? Privacy is an
    illusion, and we’re here to keep it that way.
</p>
<p>
    So, thank you for trusting us with your <span style="color: #780606;">life</span>—or at least, thank you for not
    reading the fine print. Together, we’ll
    continue to push the boundaries of what it means to live in a data-driven world, all while redefining privacy in
    ways that ensure it never interferes with our bottom line.
</p>
<p><i>This is probably a joke</i></p>
